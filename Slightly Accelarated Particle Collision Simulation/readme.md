# Gravity Ball Simulation: Physics Intuition and Formulas üéÆüåç

This project simulates the behavior of multiple balls under the influence of gravity, resembling the nature of an ideal gas. Below, we provide a detailed explanation of the physics behind the simulation, including the key formulas and their intuition.

---

## 1. **Gravity and Motion** üåç

### Gravitational Acceleration
Each ball is subject to a constant gravitational acceleration \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). In the simulation, this is scaled down by a factor of \( 0.001 \) to make the motion visually smooth:

\[
a_y = g \cdot 0.001
\]

Here, \( a_y \) is the vertical acceleration applied to each ball.

### Velocity Update
The velocity of each ball is updated every frame based on the acceleration:

\[
v_y = v_y + a_y \cdot \Delta t
\]

where:
- \( v_y \) is the vertical velocity,
- \( \Delta t \) is the time step (implicitly defined by the frame rate).

### Position Update
The position of each ball is updated using the velocity:

\[
y = y + v_y \cdot \Delta t
\]

Similarly, the horizontal position \( x \) is updated using the horizontal velocity \( v_x \):

\[
x = x + v_x \cdot \Delta t
\]

## 2. **Elastic Collisions** üí•

### Collision Detection
Collisions between two balls are detected by checking if the distance between their centers is less than the sum of their radii:

\[
\text{distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} < r_1 + r_2
\]

If this condition is true, the balls are overlapping, and a collision is resolved.

### Resolving Overlap
To resolve the overlap, the balls are moved apart along the line connecting their centers. The overlap distance is:

\[
\text{overlap} = (r_1 + r_2) - \text{distance}
\]

The balls are then moved apart by half the overlap distance:

\[
x_1 = x_1 + \frac{\text{overlap}}{2} \cdot \cos(\theta), \quad y_1 = y_1 + \frac{\text{overlap}}{2} \cdot \sin(\theta)
\]
\[
x_2 = x_2 - \frac{\text{overlap}}{2} \cdot \cos(\theta), \quad y_2 = y_2 - \frac{\text{overlap}}{2} \cdot \sin(\theta)
\]

where \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y_2 - y_1, x_2 - x_1) \) is the angle between the two centers.

### Velocity Update After Collision
The velocities of the balls are updated based on the conservation of momentum and the coefficient of restitution \( e \). The relative velocity along the line of collision is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = (v_{x2} - v_{x1}) \cdot n_x + (v_{y2} - v_{y1}) \cdot n_y
\]

where \( n_x = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{\text{distance}} \) and \( n_y = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{\text{distance}} \) are the components of the unit normal vector.

The new velocities are calculated as:

\[
v_{x1}' = v_{x1} + (1 + e) \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot v_{\text{rel}} \cdot n_x
\]
\[
v_{y1}' = v_{y1} + (1 + e) \cdot \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot v_{\text{rel}} \cdot n_y
\]
\[
v_{x2}' = v_{x2} - (1 + e) \cdot \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot v_{\text{rel}} \cdot n_x
\]
\[
v_{y2}' = v_{y2} - (1 + e) \cdot \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \cdot v_{\text{rel}} \cdot n_y
\]

Here, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two balls, and \( e \) is the coefficient of restitution (set to \( 0.8 \) in the simulation).

---

## 3. **Boundary Collisions** üõë

When a ball collides with the boundaries of the window, its velocity is reversed and scaled by the coefficient of restitution \( e \):

### Horizontal Boundaries
If the ball hits the left or right wall:

\[
v_x = -e \cdot v_x
\]

### Vertical Boundaries
If the ball hits the top or bottom wall:

\[
v_y = -e \cdot v_y
\]

The position of the ball is also adjusted to ensure it stays within the window:

\[
x = \text{clamp}(x, r, \text{WIDTH} - r)
\]
\[
y = \text{clamp}(y, r, \text{HEIGHT} - r)
\]

where \( r \) is the radius of the ball.

## 4. **Intuition Behind the Simulation** üß†

- **Gravity**: The balls accelerate downward, simulating the effect of gravity. This creates a realistic "falling" motion.
- **Elastic Collisions**: The collisions between balls conserve momentum and energy, making the simulation behave like an ideal gas. The coefficient of restitution \( e \) controls how "bouncy" the collisions are.
- **Boundary Collisions**: The walls act as perfectly elastic barriers, ensuring the balls stay within the window.

---

## 5. **Key Parameters** ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Gravity (\( g \))**: \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (scaled down by \( 0.001 \)).
- **Coefficient of Restitution (\( e \))**: \( 0.8 \) (controls the bounciness of collisions).
- **Ball Radius (\( r \))**: \( 4 \) pixels.
- **Initial Velocities**: \( v_x = 0.0 \), \( v_y = 0.0 \).

## 6. **Future Enhancements** üöÄ

- **Air Resistance**: Introduce a drag force proportional to the velocity to simulate air resistance.
- **Friction**: Add friction during collisions to make the balls eventually come to rest.
- **User Interaction**: Allow users to adjust parameters like gravity, restitution, and ball size in real-time.
