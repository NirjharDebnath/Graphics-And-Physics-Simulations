# Gravity-Based Particle Simulation

This project is a **real-time gravity-based particle simulation** implemented in **C** using the **SDL2** library. It simulates the motion of particles under the influence of gravity, incorporating collision detection and restitution mechanics. The simulation creates new particles based on mouse movements, making it interactive and visually dynamic.

## üìù Introduction

This simulation models the behavior of circular particles under gravity. The particles fall, bounce off walls, and interact with other particles through elastic collisions. The simulation is designed for real-time execution and utilizes **SDL2** for rendering and event handling.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Gravity Simulation**: Particles accelerate downwards under constant gravity.
- **Elastic Collisions**: Particles collide with each other and bounce off.
- **Boundary Handling**: Particles reflect when they hit the edges of the window.
- **Random Colors**: Each particle is rendered in a randomly assigned color.
- **Dynamic Creation**: Particles are generated at the mouse pointer's position.

### üìä Particle Structure

Each particle is represented using the following structure:

```c
struct Circle {
    double m;         // Mass of the particle
    double x, y;     // Position coordinates
    double r;       // Radius of the particle
    double velocity_x, velocity_y; // Velocity components
    Uint8 red, green, blue, a; // Color (RGBA)
};
```

### üìà Gravity and Motion

Particles experience a constant downward acceleration due to gravity:

```c
double acceleration = Gravity * 0.001;
```

The position is updated using basic kinematics:

```c
circles[i].velocity_y += acceleration;
circles[i].y += circles[i].velocity_y;
circles[i].x += circles[i].velocity_x;
```

### üîÑ Collision Detection

The simulation detects and resolves particle-particle collisions using the following approach:

1. **Distance Calculation**: If the distance between two particles is less than their combined radii, a collision occurs.

```c
double distance = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
if (distance < circles[i].r + circles[j].r) { ... }
```

2. **Collision Response**: The velocities are updated based on the coefficient of restitution (elasticity).

```c
double vi_new = vj + e * (vi - vj);
```

3. **Overlap Resolution**: Particles are pushed apart to prevent overlapping.

```c
double overlap = (circles[i].r + circles[j].r) - distance;
```

## üìö Code Walkthrough

1. **Initialization**: Sets up SDL2 window and renderer.
2. **Particle Generation**: Particles are created when the mouse moves.
3. **Physics Simulation**: Updates positions, applies gravity, handles collisions.
4. **Rendering**: Draws the grid (optional) and particles.
5. **Event Handling**: Captures SDL events (e.g., window close, mouse movement).

## üîß Customization

You can tweak the following parameters for different behaviors:

| Parameter                 | Description                       | Default Value |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| `Gravity`                 | Gravitational acceleration        | `9.8`        |
| `CELL_SIZE`               | Size of the grid cells            | `20`         |
| `RADIUS`                  | Radius of particles               | `4`          |
| `COEFF_OF_RESTITUTION`    | Elasticity of collisions (0-1)    | `0.8`        |
| `VELOCITY_X`, `VELOCITY_Y`| Initial velocity of particles     | `0.0`        |
